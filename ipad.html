      The iPad Pro is a premium model of Apple's iPad tablet computer. It runs
      iPadOS, a tablet-optimized version of the iOS operating system. The
      original iPad Pro was introduced in September 2015, and ran iOS 9. The
      second-generation iPad Pro, unveiled in June 2017, had an upgraded A10X
      Fusion chip and a larger 10.5-inch display. The third-generation iPad Pro,
      announced in October 2018, eliminated the home button, and featured an
      11-inch display and Face ID. The fourth-generation iPad Pro, introduced in
      March 2020, included the A12Z chip, and added support for the Magic
      Keyboard. The fifth-generation iPad Pro, announced in April 2021,
      incorporated a desktop-class M1 chip, making it the first iPad model to
      not use an A-series processor. The sixth- and current-generation iPad Pro,
      introduced in October 2022, includes the M2 chip, Apple Pencil Hover, and
      ProRes video.
