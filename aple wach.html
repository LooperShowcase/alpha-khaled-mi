      Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches produced by Apple Inc. It
      incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and wireless
      telecommunication, and integrates with iOS and other Apple products and
      services. The Apple Watch was released in April 2015,[18][19] and quickly
      became the best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the
      second quarter of fiscal 2015,[20] and more than 100 million people were
      estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December 2020.[21] Apple has
      introduced a new generation of the Apple Watch with improved internal
      components each September[22]—each labeled by Apple as a 'Series', with
      certain exceptions.[a] Each Series has been initially sold in multiple
      variants defined by the watch casing's material, color, and size (except
      for the budget watches Series 1 and SE, available only in
      aluminum,[23][26] and the Ultra, available only in 49 mm uncolored
      titanium[25]), and beginning with Series 3, by the option in the aluminum
      variants for LTE cellular connectivity, which comes standard with the
      other materials.[27] The band included with the watch can be selected from
      multiple options from Apple, and watch variants in aluminum co-branded
      with Nike and in stainless steel co-branded with Hermès are also offered,
      which include exclusive bands, colors, and digital watch faces carrying
      those companies' brandings.[27]
