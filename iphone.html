      The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus (also stylized as iPhone 14+) are
      smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the
      sixteenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13
      Mini, and was announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino,
      California on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro
      and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature
      a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the
      rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency
      services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular
      networks.[8][9] The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022 and
      iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022 respectively, and was
      launched with iOS 16.[5] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus
      began on September 9, 2022.[10] The iPhone 14 does not have a "Mini"
      version like the iPhone 13 Mini from last year. Instead, Apple has
      reintroduced a larger dimension iPhone 14 named the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple
      has not introduced a Plus model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017.
      iPhone 14 and 14 Plus models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro
      Max models) sold in the United States drop support for physical SIM cards,
      making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4
      to not come with a discrete SIM card reader
